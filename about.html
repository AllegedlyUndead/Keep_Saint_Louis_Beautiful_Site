        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>At <strong>Keep Saint Louis Beautiful</strong>, we are a passionate group of local volunteers dedicated to making our city cleaner and greener. Our mission is simple: to reduce litter and improve the quality of life for everyone in Saint Louis.</p>
        <p>We believe that small actions can have a big impact, and we are committed to picking up litter, raising awareness about waste management, and inspiring others to take pride in their community. Every street, every block, and every neighborhood matters â€” and together, we are making a difference.</p>
        <p>We are more than just a group of volunteers; we are a movement driven by love for our city and a shared vision of a cleaner, more vibrant Saint Louis. Join us in creating a brighter future by lending a hand or spreading the word. Together, we can help keep Saint Louis beautiful for generations to come.</p>
